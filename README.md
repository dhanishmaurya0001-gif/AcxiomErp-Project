# AcxiomErp-Project

Project Name: AcxiomERP
Made by: Dhanish Kumar Maurya (MCA Final Year Project)
Technology Used: ASP.NET Core + C# + SQL Server + Bootstrap + HTML/CSS
What is AcxiomERP?
AcxiomERP is a complete business management web application (just like the software big companies use — Tally, SAP, Zoho, etc.), but I built it from scratch as my MCA major project.
It helps small and medium companies run their entire business from one single website — no need to use Excel or many different apps.
